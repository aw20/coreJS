## Overview

The AW2.0 JavaScript library is a best practices/ design patterns library to ensure code across all projects is easily maintainable and readable by all developers current and new. As with most programming languages there are multiple way's of achieving the same result, each and everyone will approach a problem with a different mindset and all would solve the issue, but chances are there will not be two of use who write the same code as our solution.

With the AW2.0 library (`$aw2`) we have created a layer between the JavaScript library (at the moment that is jQuery) to ensure everything we are doing is being done correctly and to the best practices of the underlying library.
This library also means we have a more consistent code base for all developers, also ensuring common ways of doing things, such as event bindings is consitent through out all projects. This also gives us more flexibility in the future if we were to ever move away from jQuery.

## Usage

To use you will need the latest version of jQuery 1.9+ included in your page. After jQuery include the [AW2 JS libaray](https://raw.github.com/aw20/coreJS/master/dist/aw2-1.0.0.min.js), found in the dist folder.

You then have access to the `$aw2` methods

For documentation on methods available to you from `$aw2` see the [documentation](http://aw20.github.io/coreJS/)
